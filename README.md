# Dorian's Game Engine (WinAPI + DirectX 11)

This repository contains an **early attempt at building a small game engine** using **WinAPI** and **DirectX 11**.  
The main focus of this version was on experimenting with graphics programming and implementing **navigation mesh pathfinding (A*)**.  
It includes a basic rendering setup, a custom window and input framework, and experiments with engine structure and low-level systems.  
The engine is primarily a learning project, showcasing early approaches to performance optimization, rendering, and AI pathfinding.

## ✨ Features (so far)

- Custom **WinAPI-based framework** for window and input handling  
- Basic **DirectX 11 rendering setup**  
- **Navigation Mesh Pathfinding** (A* implementation)  
- Experiments with engine structure and low-level rendering  

---

## 🚧 Current Status

This project is **no longer actively updated**.  
Instead of fixing the outdated `main` branch, I will **restart development with DirectX 12**, building on what I learned here.

---

## 🔮 Next Steps

- Rebuild the engine from scratch with **DirectX 12**  
- Improve rendering pipeline and resource management  
- Continue experimenting with pathfinding and AI on more efficient navigation meshes  
- Aim for a cleaner architecture inspired by modern game engines  

---

## 📂 Branch Overview

- `main` – contains experimental, outdated code (not up-to-date)  
- `presentation_build` – stable branch showcasing the **pathfinding implementation**

## 🧑‍💻 About

This repository represents an early milestone in my journey into **graphics programming** and **engine development**.  
It helped me gain hands-on experience with the WinAPI, DirectX 11, and implementing core systems such as pathfinding.
