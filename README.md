# Dorian's Game Engine (WinAPI + DirectX 11)

My name is **Dorian Bach**.  
I am a software developer with professional experience in **C# and the .NET framework**, and a deep enthusiasm for **C++ and graphics programming**.  
My work spans from building reliable applications in .NET to exploring low-level performance optimization and rendering in C++.  
This website/repository is where I share some of my personal <a href="./projects">projects</a>.

---

## ✨ Features (so far)

- Custom **WinAPI-based framework** for window and input handling  
- Basic **DirectX 11 rendering setup**  
- **Navigation Mesh Pathfinding** (A* implementation)  
- Experiments with engine structure and low-level rendering  

---

## 🚧 Current Status

This project is **no longer actively updated**.  
Instead of fixing the outdated `main` branch, I will **restart development with DirectX 12**, building on what I learned here.

---

## 🔮 Next Steps

- Rebuild the engine from scratch with **DirectX 12**  
- Improve rendering pipeline and resource management  
- Continue experimenting with pathfinding and AI on more efficient navigation meshes  
- Aim for a cleaner architecture inspired by modern game engines  

---

## 📂 Branch Overview

- `main` – contains experimental, outdated code (not up-to-date)  
- `presentation_build` – stable branch showcasing the **pathfinding implementation**

## 🧑‍💻 About

This repository represents an early milestone in my journey into **graphics programming** and **engine development**.  
It helped me gain hands-on experience with the WinAPI, DirectX 11, and implementing core systems such as pathfinding.
